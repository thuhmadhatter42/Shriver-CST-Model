[# Shriver’s Complex Substrate Theory (CST) — v1.0

**Tagline:** A phase-transitional model of “dark material,” proposing that dark matter/energy phenomenology emerges from substrate-level phase behavior in spacetime-media.

## Claims (high-level, falsifiable hooks)
1. **Phase-Transitional Substrate:** Observed galactic rotation curves and lensing profiles can be reparameterized by local substrate phase fractions rather than particle abundance.
2. **Equation-Level Signature:** A macroscopic constitutive relation ties curvature-effective stress to substrate order parameter \( \phi \), with transitions at critical density/temperature.
3. **Predictive Edges:** 
   - Distinct lensing–rotation mismatches near phase boundaries.
   - Environment-dependent “dark fraction” scaling with baryonic surface density.
   - Cluster-scale residuals that depart from standard NFW fits in transitional regimes.

## Why Now
- Tension in ΛCDM small-scale structure; core–cusp and diversity problems; alternative MOND-like scalings that hint at emergent laws. CST proposes a substrate mechanism that can reproduce phenomenology *without* abandoning GR, by adding medium-like response.

## Roadmap
- v1.1 — Add formalism section (order parameter, free energy, constitutive laws); figures; minimal citations.
- v1.2 — Predictions table + comparison to MOND/ΛCDM on 3 datasets.
- v1.3 — Jupyter numerics (toy halos, lensing integrals); arXiv-ready PDF.
- v2.0 — External replication pack + data fits.
